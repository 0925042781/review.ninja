Review Ninja is a lightweight code review tool that works with GitHub, providing a more structured way to use pull requests for code review. Review Ninja dispenses with elaborate voting systems, and supports hassle-free committing and merging for acceptable changes. Our primary focus is making it easier to identify, review, collaborate and track problems with a specific pull request until they're satisfactorily addressed.

Review Ninja comes with a flexible approach to add automatic voters in addition to human voters. Auto voters, which we call "bots" can be any application or step in your continuous delivery system.

Review Ninja tries to store the least amount of information from your GitHub account to make sure the data is up to date and the data is stored at GitHub only.

Review Ninja was built to integrate into GitHub.com as well as GitHub Enterprise. The application stack includes Node.js, Express, MongoDB and AngularJS.

Why should I use Review Ninja?
------------------------------

Review Ninja defines a clearer process for code review in GitHub. Review Ninja also provides a status overview, so team members in addition to development can understand the state of the project (e.g., product management).
