Review Ninja is a lightweight code review tool based on GitHub. It aims to
provide a structured way to use pull-requests for code review, using a highly
customizable voting system. The main focus lies on pull-requests, however, it
is also possible to vote on single commits.

Review Ninja comes with a process of automating votes, which we call bots. Bots
can be any imaginable application or step in your continuous delivery system.

Review Ninja tries to store the least amount of information from your GitHub
account to make sure the data is up to date and the data is stored at GitHub
only. Currently only the email of your account is transfered to our system for
notification purposes.

Review Ninja was build to integrate into GitHub.com as well as GitHub
enterprise. The application stack includes Node.js, Express, MongoDB and
AngularJS.

Why should I use Review Ninja?
------------------------------

Review Ninja defines a more clear structure for code review in GitHub. Review
Ninja also tries to provide a more general overview of a project so people
other than the development team understand the state of the project. (eg.
possible users of a product or project management)

Try Review Ninja
----------------

Review Ninja is still in a very early stage, you can expect api and UX/UI
changes. (In fact in the current version no Design effort has been done)
