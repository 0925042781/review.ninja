Review Ninja is a lightweight code review tool that works with GitHub. It provides a more structured way to use pull-requests for code review, adding a highly customizable voting system. Though it's primarily designed for use with pull-requests, it's also possible to vote on single commits.

Review Ninja comes with a flexible approach to add automatic voters in addition to human voters. Auto voters, which we call "bots" can be any application or step in your continuous delivery system.

Review Ninja tries to store the least amount of information from your GitHub account to make sure the data is up to date and the data is stored at GitHub only. Currently only the email of your account is transfered to our system for
notification purposes.

Review Ninja was built to integrate into GitHub.com as well as GitHub Enterprise. The application stack includes Node.js, Express, MongoDB and AngularJS.

Why should I use Review Ninja?
------------------------------

Review Ninja defines a clearer process for code review in GitHub. Review Ninja also provides a status overview, so team members in addition to development can understand the state of the project (e.g., product management).
