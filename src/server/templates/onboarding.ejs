# ReviewNinja-Welcome

**Thanks for letting us show you around!**

What you’re seeing here is a GitHub pull request with the code diffs
showing by default. Feel free to look around.

Over on the right is a panel for line notes that you can connect to a
line of code in the diff. Line notes are threads of pull request review
comments on a single line.

Line notes have flags such that you can mark issues in the code either
**open** or **closed**. Flags are as follows:

* **open** - !fix, !resolve
* **closed** - !fixed, !resolved, !completed

To add a flag to a line note, you have two options:

* You can simply leave a comment with the flag relevant to the state you think the code is in.
* On the list view, click on the dropdown of the line note you wish to change the status of and change it.

Another key feature you need to know about is ninja stars. Ninja 
stars are how you communicate that a pull request is okay to merge. 
You can set, by repository, how many ninja stars you think pull 
requests should have before merging.

**To add a ninja star**, click the **ninja star** button.

When your pull request no longer has any open line notes, and has received 
a sufficient number of ninja stars, it’s ready to merge!

**To merge the pull request**, click **Merge pull request**.

That’s it! These are the basic features of ReviewNinja to help you get 
started. We hope you enjoy using the tool, and please 
[let us know](https://github.com/reviewninja/review.ninja/issues/new) 
how we can make it better.
